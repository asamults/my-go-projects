Two-thirds of food waste happens not because food is bad, but because we can't tell when it's actually still good. People throw away perfectly edible food out of caution, confusion, or habit, often relying on printed “use by” dates that are just rough estimates.

We believe there’s a better way. By making freshness measurable, we can reduce waste, improve safety, and reshape how the world thinks about expiry.

Our mission is to make use-by dates digital - smarter, fairer, and based on science.

We replace use-by dates with smart labels that measure freshness, and AI that predicts shelf-life. The founders invented this technology as PhD scientists, and we're using it to improve the whole supply chain, starting with food producers.

We’re a tight-knit team that believes innovation happens when everyone’s ideas are heard - no egos, no silos, just a shared goal.
