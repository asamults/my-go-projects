# My Go Projects

## Purpose
This repository contains personal **Go projects** demonstrating programming skills, automation, and CLI tools. 
It serves as a portfolio for **Junior Go / Software Engineer roles (UK / Remote)**.

## Projects

### 1. Line Counter (`linecounter`)
- CLI tool that counts lines in files and directories.
- Demonstrates file handling, recursion, and basic error handling in Go.

### 2. Multiplication (`multiplication`)
- Simple CLI program for arithmetic operations.
- Demonstrates Go basics: functions, loops, input/output.

### 3. Phone (`phone`)
- Mini project simulating a phonebook.
- Demonstrates structs, slices, maps, and data manipulation in Go.

### 4. TCP Chat (`tcpchat`)
- Simple chat server and client using TCP sockets.
- Demonstrates Go networking, concurrency (goroutines), and channels.

### 5. PISCINE (submodule) (`PISCINE`)
- Collection of small Go exercises.
- Added as a **submodule** to preserve full Git history.
- Demonstrates Go fundamentals, algorithms, and problem-solving.
- To clone the repository including submodule:
```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/asamults/my-go-projects.git

git submodule update --init --recursive


6. Git Cheatsheet (git_cheatsheet.md)

    Reference guide for Git commands, created to support workflow in Go projects.

Technologies

    Go (1.20+)

    Standard Library: fmt, os, net, bufio, etc.

    Linux / CLI environment

    Git for version control and submodule management
